	abstract     = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion have been linked to increased average global temperatures, a global challenge for many decades. Mitigating CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is a priority for the protection of the environment. This is a comparison of the three main technological categories available for CO2 capture and storage. They include: oxy-fuel combustion, pre-combustion, and post-combustion. Each capture technology has inherent benefits and disadvantages in cost, implementation, and flexibility, but post-combustion CO2 capture has demonstrated the most promising results in typical power plant configurations. This paper presents a review of different post-combustion CO2 capture materials; solvents, membranes, and adsorbents, focusing on economical and environmentally safe low to high temperature solid adsorbents. Furthermore, the authors summarize the advantages and limitations of the materials investigated to provide insight into the challenges and opportunities currently facing the development of post-combustion CO2 capture technologies. The solid sorbents currently available for CO2 capture are also reviewed in detail, including physical and chemical properties, reactions, and current research efforts on improvement.},

	abstract     = {The Power-to-Gas (PtG) process chain could play a significant role in the future energy system. Renewable electric energy can be transformed into storable methane via electrolysis and subsequent methanation. This article compares the available electrolysis and methanation technologies with respect to the stringent requirements of the PtG chain such as low CAPEX, high efficiency, and high flexibility. Three water electrolysis technologies are considered: alkaline electrolysis, PEM electrolysis, and solid oxide electrolysis. Alkaline electrolysis is currently the cheapest technology; however, in the future PEM electrolysis could be better suited for the PtG process chain. Solid oxide electrolysis could also be an option in future, especially if heat sources are available. Several different reactor concepts can be used for the methanation reaction. For catalytic methanation, typically fixed-bed reactors are used; however, novel reactor concepts such as three-phase methanation and micro reactors are currently under development. Another approach is the biochemical conversion. The bioprocess takes place in aqueous solutions and close to ambient temperatures. Finally, the whole process chain is discussed. Critical aspects of the PtG process are the availability of CO2 sources, the dynamic behaviour of the individual process steps, and especially the economics as well as the efficiency.}

	abstract     = {Electrification is a key strategy for decarbonizing the industrial sector. Industrial process heating, which still relies heavily on fossil fuel combustion and accounts for the majority of sector wide GHG emissions, is a particularly attractive electrification target. Electrifying industrial boilers represents a cross-cutting opportunity for GHG emissions reductions, given their widespread use in most manufacturing industries. Yet, there are gaps in the understanding of the current population of conventional industrial boilers in the United States that preclude a characterization of boiler electrification's technical potential to reduce fuel consumption and GHG emissions. In this study, we develop an up-to-date dataset of the industrial boiler population in the U.S. and quantify the county-level electricity requirements and net changes in fuel use and GHG emissions under the current electric grid and theoretical future grid scenarios. Our results show an increase of 105 MMmtCO2e and 73 MMmtCO2e in GHG emissions from boiler electrification, with and without the replacement of byproduct fuels, respectively, under the current electric grid, and a reduction of 19 MMmtCO2e and 7 MMmtCO2e in GHG emissions under a future high renewables electric grid. GHG emissions savings are currently possible only in certain regions of the U.S. unless future grids are decarbonized. We also provide discussion that could be useful for policy makers and manufacturing facilities for advancing the electrification of industrial boilers in locations and industries toward fuel savings and GHG emissions reductions.},

With fluctuations in fuel prices, limited electricity supply, boiler reliability, and government emission limits, it is a challenge for department utilities to produce steam. Planning and selection of boiler operations to produce steam to meet the needs of the smelting process are necessary in order to minimize operating costs and maintain boiler reliability in distributing steam. This condition makes mixed integer programming become the best method to solve the model. Mathematical models are used to determine boiler operations in the wet season and dry season by using mixed integer programming methods. In the wet season, boilers that use electricity can operate because electricity from hydropower is sufficient, although not fully the boiler can meet the steam needed. Whereas in the dry season boilers that use electricity cannot operate due to limited electricity supply generated from hydropower.},
